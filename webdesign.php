            <p class="infotext">BrannonWorks started as a class project; a way to showcase a &quot;portfolio&quot;. The class is long over but the site has become a small obsession of mine. It has evolved from a small project site to a full-blown online showcase. Since its birth it has seen the addition of a blog and started to develop a web design gallery. The blog started as a side project to experiment with <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> and is now the newest addition to the family. At any one time, it can show current projects, links to other very cool projects, links I want to share or even just things I don’t want to forget; it’s sort of an online database.</p>

            <p class="projtitle">Spencer Canoes | Shady Grove Campground</p>
            <p class="infotext">Spencer Canoes &amp; Shady Grove Campground is a small campground in Martindale, Texas. The Manager needed an updated site, as the old one became graphically outdated and spyware infested. I worked on a team of four to design and develop their new website. The results are a site with both the campground, and their sister site "Spencer Canoes" enveloped in one place.</p>
