            <p class="infotext">Hello, and welcome. 

BrannonWorks.com is host to digital samples of some of the work I have been doing the last few years. I am a soon-to-be graduate from the <a href="http://www.uwm.edu" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin â€“ Milwaukee</a>. I have a high vocabulary for design and plan on living my life persuing as many of these interesting paths as I can.<br/>
<br/>
My primary education and degree is in Architectural studies, but I am also a motivated and talented amateur photographer, web site designer/developer, wood worker, and graphic designer.
I have ideas and design anything I can get my hands on. My site is host to a select few of my completed projects, but there are always more in the works. <br/>
<br/>

Feel free to send any questions or comments to my email: <a href="mailto:sam@brannonworks.com">sam@brannonworks.com</a></p>
